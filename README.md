# SuperSlicer Documentation

SuperSlicer documentation is using Mkdocs and Material for Mkdocs.

## Goals and guidelines for the documentation:
The main goal with is to have the most comprehensive documentation of any slicer software out there. Easily searchable, and easy to navigate are really important. And on the backend, easy to update and maintain. Cura documentation is very good but, hard to find and navigate. Bambu Studios is really good as well. Both can be used as a guide to what information should be included and even a bit on how we lay out the file structure/navigation. Slic3r docs are pretty good as well and a good reference point for some SuperSlicer things that were inherited. Links to these doc sites for reference:
