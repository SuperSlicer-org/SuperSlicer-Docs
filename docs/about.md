# About SuperSlicer

## Development

### What language is it written in?

Almost everything is written in C++.

The slicing core is the `libslic3r` library, which can be built and used in a standalone way. The command-line interface is a thin wrapper over `libslic3r`. You can download SuperSlicer from the [links](https://www.superslicer.org/resources/links/) page on our website.

### Can I help?

Sure! There is two ways to get involved. First engage our team in our Discord and share with them how you believe you might be helpful. The second way is to surf to our [website](https://www.superslicer.org) and submit the from requesting to join one of our [QA Teams](https://www.superslicer.org/superslicer-v2-7-x-alpha-beta-qa-production-teams/).

### What should I do if I believe I may have found a bug?

If you believe you may have some something that is not behaving as you believe it should be, your first step is always to hop onto our Discord, go into the "problem_help" channel, and SEARCH to see if anyone else has brought it up. If someone has, then please tag the orginial post about it and add what you are seeing to the discussion. If it has not been brought up, then by all means share what you are seeing.

Please release we are a group of vulunteers and it may take a few days before someone from our team responds.

We ALWAYS start any challenge on Discord now, since in a lot of cases we find that it is a unique combination of settings that may be involved with your challenge. Which may or may not mean a bug. If it is a bug, our development team might just take it right from the discussion on Discord, or they may request you submit an issue on GitHub.

Moving forward, BEFORE an issue is opened on our GitHub it must first be discussed on Discord.
