# About SuperSlicer


## Development

### What language is it written in?

Almost everything is written in C++.

The slicing core is the `libslic3r` library, which can be built and used in a standalone way. The command-line interface is a thin wrapper over `libslic3r`. You can download a precompiled package from the release page - it will run without the need for any dependency.
