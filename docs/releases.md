## Stable Release ##

Our current stable release vesion is: 2.5.59.13

## Latest Beta Release ##

Our current Beta release version is: 2.7.61.7

This version is stable enough to become the new stable release. As is with any software application there are some rare edge case challenges, but they are not critical enough to be a roadblock in the formal release.

2.5.60.X: The always was a Beta version containing several roadblocker bugs. Including, but not limited to, segfaulting with paint on seams.
